# Introduction
In this project, I performed statistical and exploratory analysis of the Airbnb dataset for New York City. My aim was to observe how features present in the dataset behave separately and with each other and to provide insights that can help Airbnb enhance decision-making and improve profitability.

# Data Preparation and Cleaning
In this section, I loaded the dataset using Pandas, checked basic information about the dataset, and fixed any missing or incorrect values.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
I performed in-depth analysis on multiple features and used data visualization techniques to gain valuable insights for business. I analyzed the various aspects of the dataset, including price distribution, availability, location, and characteristics of the listings. I also made an interactive geographical map with colors denoted by listing prices and identified the top 10 most reviewed listings on Airbnb for NYC with their average price.

Manhattan has the highest average listing price at $150 per night, followed by Brooklyn at $90 per night. Queens and Staten Island have similar price distributions, while the Bronx is the cheapest of them all. The most popular boroughs for Airbnb listings are Bedford-Stuyvesant and Williamsburg in Brooklyn and Harlem in Manhattan. The top 10 most reviewed listings on Airbnb for NYC have an average price of $65 per night, and 9/10 of the listings are Private room types.

# Summary and Conclusion
The in-depth data exploration conducted on each important column supplied by this Airbnb dataset proved to be a highly rich dataset with a range of columns. My analysis provided valuable insights for Airbnb to enhance decision-making and improve profitability. The interactive geographical map with colors denoted by listing prices can help users easily find and book listings in their preferred locations and price range.
